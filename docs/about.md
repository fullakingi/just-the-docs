## Te Kaupapa o Te Pūtahi
We created Te Pūtahi to give a Māori perspective to scientific research and make it useful for our haukāinga. To assist our communities to survive, revive and thrive. 

- <strong>Survive:</strong> We look at the data and historical background of Māori well-being and Government response in relation to treaty obligations.  

- <strong>Revive:</strong> We seek to understand how current scientific research may align with haukāinga practices, for example, does the science align with haukāinga as kaitiaki of the whēnua, awa and moana?

- <strong>Thrive:</strong> We explore ways to enhance resilience within our whānau, hapu and iwi and unlock new potential according to Māori priorities.  
<br>

### Ka ora pea i a koe, ka ora koe i au.

_Perhaps I survive because of you and you survive because of me._  
<br>
Te Pūtahi - The Nexus aims to:

1. Make scientific research useful to haukāinga.

2. Support haukāinga in articulating concerns, particularly in the way data informs (or does not inform) institutional mechanisms.

3. Discuss better responses for haukāinga in the present and in the future. 

4. To uphold the mana of our traditional knowledge, the mana of our tūpuna and place it thoughtfully in today’s world.
