## Te Kaupapa
We created Te Pūtahi to give a Māori perspective to research and make it useful for our haukāinga. To assist our communities to survive, revive and thrive. 

- <strong>Survive:</strong> We look at the current state of Māori well-being and Government response in relation to treaty obligations.  

- <strong>Revive:</strong> We examine resilience by understanding how science aligns with traditional practices, for example, how our tūpuna lived with the whēnua, awa and moana.  

- <strong>Thrive:</strong> We explore ways to enhance resilience within our whānau, hapu and iwi and unlock new potential according to Māori priorities.


Te Pūtahi - The Nexus aims to:


1. Ensure a better response for Māori in the present and in the future. 

2. To make scientific information useful so haukāinga can process informed decisions.

3. To support haukāinga in articulating their concerns.

4. To raise general awareness and foster debate.

5. To uphold the traditional knowledge of our tūpuna and continue to place it in today’s world.

Perhaps I survive because of you and you survive because of me.
